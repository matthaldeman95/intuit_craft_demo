class Migration(object***REMOVED***:
    ***REMOVED***
    The base class for all migrations.

    Migration files will import this from django.db.migrations.Migration
    and subclass it as a class called Migration. It will have one or more
    of the following attributes:

     - operations: A list of Operation instances, probably from django.db.migrations.operations
     - dependencies: A list of tuples of (app_path, migration_name***REMOVED***
     - run_before: A list of tuples of (app_path, migration_name***REMOVED***
     - replaces: A list of migration_names

    Note that all migrations come out of migrations and into the Loader or
    Graph as instances, having been initialized with their app label and name.
