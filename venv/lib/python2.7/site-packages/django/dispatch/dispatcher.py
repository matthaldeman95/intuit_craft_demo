        Connect receiver to sender for signal.

        Arguments:

            receiver
                A function or an instance method which is to receive signals.
                Receivers must be hashable objects.

                If weak is True, then receiver must be weak referenceable.

                Receivers must be able to accept keyword arguments.

                If a receiver is connected with a dispatch_uid argument, it
                will not be added if another receiver was already connected
                with that dispatch_uid.

            sender
                The sender to which the receiver should respond. Must either be
                a Python object, or None to receive events from any sender.

            weak
                Whether to use weak references to the receiver. By default, the
                module will attempt to use weak references to the receiver
                objects. If this parameter is false, then strong references will
                be used.

            dispatch_uid
                An identifier used to uniquely identify a particular instance of
                a receiver. This will usually be a string, though it may be
                anything hashable.

    def send(self, sender, **named***REMOVED***:
        ***REMOVED***
        Send signal from sender to all connected receivers.

        If any receiver raises an error, the error propagates back through send,
        terminating the dispatch loop. So it's possible that all receivers
        won't be called if an error is raised.

        Arguments:

            sender
                The sender of the signal. Either a specific object or None.

            named
                Named arguments which will be passed to receivers.

        Send signal from sender to all connected receivers catching errors.

        Arguments:

            sender
                The sender of the signal. Can be any python object (normally one
                registered with a connect if you actually want something to

                arguments must be a subset of the argument names defined in
                providing_args.

        Return a list of tuple pairs [(receiver, response***REMOVED***, ... ***REMOVED***. May raise
        DispatcherKeyError.

        If any receiver raises an error (specifically any subclass of
